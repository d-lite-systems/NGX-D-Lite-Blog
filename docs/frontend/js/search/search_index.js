7.0.2.\nPrerequisites\n\nInstall Node.js and MongoDB\nInstall Angular CLI: npm i -g @angular/cli\nFrom project root folder install all the dependencies: npm i\n\nCLI Workspaces\nSince CLI v6, CLI workspaces containing multiple projects, such as multiple applications or libraries. CLI projects will now use angular.json instead of .angular-cli.json for build and project configuration.\nEach CLI workspace has projects, each project has targets, and each target can have configurations.\n{\n  \"projects\": {\n    \"my-project-name\": {\n      \"projectType\": \"application\",\n      \"architect\": {\n        \"build\": {\n          \"configurations\": {\n            \"production\": {},\n            \"demo\": {},\n            \"staging\": {},\n          }\n        },\n        \"serve\": {},\n        \"extract-i18n\": {},\n        \"test\": {},\n      }\n    },\n    \"my-project-name-e2e\": {}\n  },\n}ng add\nAnother new CLI command ng add  makes adding new capabilities to your project easy. ng add will use your package manager to download new dependencies and invoke an installation script (implemented as a schematic) which can update your project with configuration changes, add additional dependencies (e.g. polyfills), or scaffold package-specific initialization code.\nTry out some of the following on your fresh ng new application:\nng add @angular/pwa — Turn your application into a PWA by adding an app manifest and service worker\nng add @ng-bootstrap/schematics — Add ng-bootstrap to your application\nng add @angular/material — Install and setup Angular Material and theming and register new starter components into ng generate\nng add @clr/angular@next — Install and setup Clarity from VMWare\nng add @angular/elements — Add the needed document-register-element.js polyfill and dependencies for Angular Elements (see below)\nBecause ng add is built on top of schematics and the npm registry, our hope is that libraries and the community will help us build a rich ecosystem of ng add supporting packages.\ne you have run ng add @angular/material to add material to an existing application, you will also be able to generate 3 new starter components.\nMaterial Sidenav\nYou can now generate a starter component including a toolbar with the app name and the side navigation. This component is responsive based on breakpoints.\nRun: ng generate @angular/material:material-nav --name=my-nav\nMaterial Dashboard\nYou can now generate a starter dashboard component containing a dynamic grid list of cards.\nRun: ng generate @angular/material:material-dashboard --name=my-dashboard\nMaterial Data Table\nYou can generate a starter data table component that is pre-configured with a datasource for sorting and pagination.\nRun: ng generate @angular/material:material-table --name=my-table\nDevelopment server\nnpm run dev: concurrently execute MongoDB, Angular build, TypeScript compiler and Express server.\nA window will automatically open at localhost:4200. Angular and Express files are being watched. Any change automatically creates a new bundle, restart Express server and reload your browser.\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nProduction mode\nnpm run prod: run the project with a production bundle and AOT compilation listening at localhost:3000 \nRun ng build--prod flag for a production build. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. \nDeploy (Heroku)\n\nGo to Heroku and create a new app (eg: your-app-name)\nInstall Heroku CLI\nheroku login\nmkdir your-app-name && cd your-app-name\ngit init\nheroku git:remote -a your-app-name\nDownload this repo and copy all files into your-app-name folder\nnpm i\nEdit package.json as following:\nadd this line to scripts: \"postinstall\": \"tsc -p srv && ng build --prod\"\nmove the following packages from devDependencies to dependencies: @angular/cli, @angular/compiler-cli, @types/jasmine, @types/node, chai, chai-http and typescript.\n\n\nEdit .env and replace the MongoDB URI with a real remote MongoDB server. You can create a MongoDB server with Heroku or mLab.\ngit add .\ngit commit -am \"Make it beter\"\ngit push heroku master\nheroku open and a window will open with your app online\n\nLibrary Support\nOne of the most requested features for our CLI has been support for creating and building libraries, and we are proud to introduce:\nng generate library \nTree Shakable Providers\nTo make your applications smaller, we’ve moved from modules referencing services to services referencing modules. This allows us to only bundle services into your code base in modules where they are injected.\nBefore\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  providers: [MyService]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class MyService {\n  constructor() { }\n}After\nNo references are needed in our NgModule.\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root',\n})\nexport class MyService {\n  constructor() { }\n}Animations Performance Improvements\nWe’ve updated our implementation of Animations to no longer need the web animations polyfill. This means that you can remove this polyfill from your application and save approximately 47KB of bundle size, while increasing animations performance in Safari at the same time.\nRxJS v6\nAngular has been updated to use v6 of RxJS. RxJS is an independent project that released v6 several weeks ago. RxJS v6 brings with it several major changes, along with a backwards compatibility package rxjs-compat that will keep your applications working.\nRxJS has been rearranged to make it more tree-shakable, ensuring that only the pieces of RxJS that you use are included in your production bundles.\nIf you use ng update, your application should keep working, but you can learn more about 7.0 migration.\nLong Term Support (LTS)\nWe are expanding our Long Term Support to all major releases.\nEach major release will be supported for 18 months with around 6 months of active development followed by 12 months of critical bugfixes and security patches.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 D-Lite Systems\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
